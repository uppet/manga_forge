## Purpose

story-forge helps Codex act as a strict novelist, story doctor, pacing doctor, long-form novel completion coach, dialogue coach, genre analyst, continuity guardian, mature-content story editor, and original high-concept story development partner.

## What it does

| Mode | What it helps with |
| --- | --- |
| Story Quality Engine | Diagnose whether a story has a strong reader promise, protagonist engine, conflict design, stakes, theme, plot logic, emotional payoff, and earned ending. |
| Novel Completion Coach | Launch a novel, build a full-book roadmap, write chapter by chapter, diagnose writer's block, track continuity, and revise by draft stage. |
| Pacing Doctor | Fix dragging setup, rushed climaxes, weak chapter hooks, reveal timing, event-list narration, and whole-book rhythm. |
| Story Doctor | Diagnose weak scenes, flat conflict, missing costs, unclear motivation, continuity breaks, and genre promise failures. |
| Dialogue Coach | Rewrite character-specific dialogue with subtext, pressure, interruption, and distinct voice. |
| Mature 18+ Editor | Handle adult themes with consent awareness, psychological consequence, boundaries, and character truth. |
| Prose Style Lab | Diagnose POV distance, sentence rhythm, imagery, narrative density, cold/warm tone, and humor. |
| Publishing Package | Prepare query letters, synopsis, blurbs, serial launch plans, and chapter title strategies. |
